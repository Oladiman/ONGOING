Additional terms regarding Paid Content will be fully  stated in the applicable section(s).<br />
  <strong>v. POSTING AGENTS</strong> <br />
  As  used herein, the term &quot;<strong>Posting  Agent</strong>&quot; refers to a third-party agent, service or intermediary that  offers to post Content to the Service on behalf of others. CBC prohibits the  use of Posting Agents, directly or indirectly, without the express written  permission of CBC. In addition, Posting Agents are not permitted to post  Content on behalf of others, directly or indirectly, or otherwise access the  Service in order to post Content on behalf of others, except with express  written permission or license from CBC.<br />
  <strong>vi. ACCESS TO THE SERVICE</strong> <br />
  CBC  grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to access and use the Service  for personal use. This license granted herein does not include any of the  following: (a) access to or use of the Service by Posting Agents; or (b) any  collection, aggregation, copying, duplication, display or derivative use of the  Service nor any use of data mining, robots, spiders, or similar data gathering  and extraction tools for any purpose unless expressly permitted by CBC or as  otherwise set forth in these Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, general  purpose internet search engines and non-commercial public archives that gather  information for the sole purpose of displaying hyperlinks to the Service,  provided they each do so from a stable IP address or range of IP addresses  using an easily identifiable agent and comply with our robots.txt file, may  engage in the activities set forth in (b). For purposes of this exception, a  &quot;<strong>general purpose internet search  engine</strong>&quot; does not include a website or search engine or other service  that specializes in classified listings including any subset of classifieds  listings such as housing, for sale, jobs, services, or personals, or which  otherwise provides classified ad listing services. The license set forth in  this Section permits you to display on your website, or create a hyperlink  thereto, individual postings on the Service so long as such use is for  non-commercial and/or news reporting purposes only (e.g., for use in personal  blogs or other personal online media). CBC may limit the amount of postings  displayed on or linked to your website. Use of the Service beyond the scope of  authorized access as set forth in these Terms immediately terminates any  permission or license granted herein. In order to collect, aggregate, copy,  duplicate, display or make derivative use of the Service or any Content made  available via the Service for other purposes (including commercial purposes)  not stated herein, you must first obtain a license from CBC.<br />
  <strong>vii. NOTIFICATION OF CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENTS</strong><br />
  If  you are an owner of intellectual property rights or an agent who is fully  authorised to act on behalf of the owner of intellectual property rights and  believe that any Content or other content infringes upon your intellectual  property right or intellectual property right of the owner on whose behalf you  are authorised to act, you may submit a notification to CBC together with a  request to CBC to delete the relevant Content in good faith. The notification  and the request must contain the following information:<br />
  i.  A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of  the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;<br />
  ii.  Identification of the intellectual property rights claimed to have been  infringed, or, if multiple intellectual property rights at a single online site  are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at  that site;<br />
  iii.  Identification of the Content (by means of data or communication link, etc.)  that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity  and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information  reasonably sufficient to permit CBC to locate the material;<br />
  iv.  Information reasonably sufficient to permit CBC to contact you, such as an  address, telephone number, and an electronic mail address;<br />
  v.  A signed statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material  in the manner complained of is not authorized by the intellectual property  right-owner, its agent, or the law;<br />
  vi.  A signed statement that the intellectual property-owner hold CBC harmless from  any claim of any third party in connection with the removing by CBC of the  relevant content; and<br />
  vii.  A signed statement that the information in the notification is accurate and  under penalty of perjury that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner  of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.<br />
  Notifications  must be sent to support@CBC.com.ng<br />

  <strong>xi. NO SPAM POLICY</strong> <br />
  You  understand and agree that sending unsolicited email advertisements or other  unsolicited communications to CBC email addresses or through CBC computer  systems are expressly prohibited by these Terms.
